# Buck: Automated Advanced Persistence Threat (APT) Hunter

## Still Under Progress

This tool is still in progress but the idea here is to create a PowerShell script to hunt for potential IOCs of APTs. For now, I have added file path IOC detection for the BackdoorDiplomacy group. A Python script is also available that will take a complete file path text file input and output a PowerShell hashtable, which you can feed into the "buck.ps1" script.
